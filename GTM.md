# Arc Vision RL: Go-to-Market Strategy
*Confidence-Gated Tool Learning for Production Vision Systems*

---

## Executive Summary

**The Opportunity**: Multi-modal RL market has no dominant players, with a 6-9 month window before well-funded competitors (Adept $415M, Multimodal NY) pivot into our space. Current VLMs achieve only 0.5% accuracy on UI detection - a genuine technical gap we can exploit.

**Our Bet**: Small models + strategic tool use + production learning beats large static models. Technical buyers will pay for reliability improvement they can "feel" - everything else stays under the hood.

**Risk**: Commoditization window is narrow. We must prove production reliability, not just research metrics, before competitors catch up.

### Competitive Intel Deep Dive

**Direct Threats (6-9 month window):**
- **Multimodal (NY)**: "Dozens of high-profile customers" in fintech/insurance, selected for Google Cloud AI Accelerator 2025
- **Adept AI**: $415M war chest, could verticalize into document space
- **Future AGI**: $1.6M, evaluation-first approach to continuous improvement

**Indirect Threats:**
- Legacy DocAI players adding "learning" features
- Big Tech extending platforms (OpenAI fine-tuning, Google Document AI)

**Customer Pain from Research:**
> "Many have tried proof-of-concepts with vision+language models and encountered limitations: e.g. an AI that misreads slightly blurry text or outputs inconsistent results, undermining trust."

**Our Response**: Confidence-gated reliability + transparent tool use + production learning cycle.

## 4. Product-Market Fit Validation

### The PoC Strategy

**Core Assumption to Test**: 
> "A customer can interact with and 'feel' the difference in performance on the specific task - everything else is under the hood"

**Validation Method**: Interactive demo showing visceral improvement
```
Demo Flow:
Input: Blurry UI screenshot
├─ Baseline model: Wrong bounding box (0.5% accuracy)
├─ Fixed-policy tools: Slight improvement 
└─ Arc model: Correctly zooms in → Accurate detection ([X]% accuracy)
```

### Success Metrics for PoC

**Technical Validation:**
- [ ] Achieve >20% accuracy improvement from 0.5% baseline
- [ ] Demonstrate 95%+ tool parsing reliability
- [ ] Show interpretable confidence thresholds (τ = 0.7 optimal)

**Market Validation:**
- [ ] 50+ interactive demo sessions within 2 weeks
- [ ] 10+ qualified customer conversations
- [ ] 3+ design partners willing to share production data
- [ ] Clear ROI story: "Save X hours/week" or "Reduce errors by Y%"

### Risk Mitigation: The "Hallucination Plateau"

**Risk**: Hit accuracy ceiling at 15-20% due to fundamental VLM limitations
**Mitigation**: Contingency messaging - "We've proven the learning works; next phase optimizes for your specific edge cases"
**Backup plan**: Pivot to "learning efficiency" story if absolute accuracy gains plateau

## Conclusion

**The Window is Open**: Multi-modal RL market lacks dominant players, customer pain is real and quantifiable, and technical approach is differentiated.

**Speed is Critical**: 6-9 month window before well-funded competitors pivot into our space.

**Execution Focus**: Production reliability over research metrics, customer-specific value over general capability, transparent learning over black box AI.

**Success Depends On**: Achieving visceral accuracy improvement customers can "feel," building trust through transparency, and moving fast enough to establish category leadership before the window closes.

The opportunity is real. The competition is coming. Time to ship.
