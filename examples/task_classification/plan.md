Task Classification with VLM Judge - Implementation Scope

  Context

  A customer needs a screenshot classifier that determines if users are "on-task" or "off-task" based on a task description. They currently use prompt engineering with
  real-time human feedback to handle edge cases, but want to explore if model retraining can outperform this approach. They need a fast turnaround and high-quality
  results.

  This document outlines the implementation scope for adding this capability to the verl framework, inspired by techniques from Seed 1.5's technical report, particularly
  their VLM-as-reward-model and verifiable rewards approaches.

  Background from Analysis

  Current State

  - The verl framework has strong vision-language model support (Qwen2.5-VL)
  - Existing arc_vision example demonstrates UI element detection with confidence-gated tool learning
  - Core GRPO implementation is mature and production-ready
  - The framework already handles multi-modal data and distributed training well

  Key Requirements

  1. Binary classification: "on-task" vs "off-task"
  2. Real-time feedback integration from users correcting misclassifications
  3. Synthetic data generation from corrections to improve edge case handling
  4. Fast convergence (days, not weeks)
  5. Must outperform prompt engineering approach

  Technical Approach

  Based on Seed 1.5's success with VLM judges and verifiable rewards:
  - Use a larger VLM (Qwen2.5-VL-72B) as a judge to verify student model (Qwen2.5-VL-3B) predictions
  - Implement verifiable visual features (window titles, UI elements) for rule-based verification
  - Create synthetic variants of corrected examples for data augmentation
  - Use hybrid reward combining VLM judge scores with verifiable features

  Implementation Plan
