# Arc Vision Training Status

## Good News!

From the logs, we can see that training was starting successfully:

1. **Model Loading**: Successfully loaded "Loading checkpoint shards: 100%|██████████| 2/2"
2. **Tool Config**: Successfully loaded all 3 tools (zoom_ui_element, wait_for_ui, inspect_element)
3. **Batch Capturing**: "Capturing batches (avail_mem=26.02 GB): 100%|██████████| 23/23"
4. **Multi-GPU**: Running on 2 GPUs as configured
5. **Custom Reward**: No errors about reward model path

## The Only Issue

The training failed because WandB (Weights & Biases) logging was enabled but no API key was configured:
```
wandb.errors.errors.UsageError: api_key not configured (no-tty)
```

## Solutions

### Option 1: Run without WandB (Recommended for Quick Start)
```bash
bash examples/arc_vision/run_arc_vision_3b_fixed.sh
```

### Option 2: Enable WandB
```bash
# First, set your WandB API key
export WANDB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Then run with WandB support
bash examples/arc_vision/run_arc_vision_with_wandb.sh
```

### Option 3: Login to WandB First
```bash
# Interactive login
wandb login

# Then run any script
bash examples/arc_vision/run_arc_vision_3b_fixed.sh
```

## What This Means

- VERL is correctly configured
- Hydra configuration is working
- Custom reward function is loaded
- Multi-turn tools are configured
- Model is loading properly
- Flash Attention is working (no errors)
- Training would have started if not for WandB

Just disable WandB or provide an API key, and training should proceed!
