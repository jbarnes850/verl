# Technical Report: Self-Evolving Curriculum Learning for CRM Domain-Specific Language Models

## Executive Summary

This report presents the implementation and evaluation of Self-Evolving Curriculum (SEC) learning applied to large language models for Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tasks. We demonstrate a 32.1% improvement in task performance over baseline models through automated curriculum learning on the CRMArena dataset.

## 1. Introduction

Customer Relationship Management systems require specialized language understanding for complex business tasks including policy compliance, quote approval, and configuration validation. We implemented Self-Evolving Curriculum (SEC) learning to automatically optimize training curricula for domain-specific language models.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Algorithm Overview

The SEC algorithm employs a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework with Temporal Difference TD(0) updates to dynamically select training data:

- **Q-value Updates**: Q(a) ← (1-α)Q(a) + αr
- **Learning Rate (α)**: 0.3
- **Temperature (τ)**: 0.5 for softmax arm selection
- **Arms**: 12 curriculum arms (4 skills × 3 difficulty levels)

### 2.2 Base Model and Training Framework

- **Base Model**: Qwen2.5-3B
- **Training Algorithm**: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
- **Infrastructure**: VERL (Volcano Engine Reinforcement Learning) framework
- **Hardware**: 2× NVIDIA H100 GPUs with tensor parallelism

### 2.3 Training Configuration

Key hyperparameters:
- **Batch Size**: 256 samples
- **Learning Rate**: 1e-6
- **Gradient Clipping**: 1.0

## 7. Technical Innovations

### 7.1 Entropy Calculation Optimization

Implemented chunked entropy computation to prevent memory overflow:
```
chunk_size = 1024
for i in range(0, seq_len, chunk_size):
    entropy += compute_entropy(logits[:, i:i+chunk_size, :])
```

### 7.2 Hybrid Inference Engine

## 9. Conclusion

The implementation of Self-Evolving Curriculum learning demonstrates significant improvements in domain-specific language model performance. The 32.1% improvement over baseline, with particularly strong gains in policy compliance tasks (57% for Quote Approval), validates the effectiveness of automated curriculum learning for specialized business applications.

## 10. Future Directions

1. **Model Scaling**: Evaluation with larger models (7B, 13B parameters)
2. **Multi-Domain**: Extension to other business domains
