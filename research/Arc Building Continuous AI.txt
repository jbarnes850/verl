Arc is the autonomous engine that teaches AI agents to fix themselves using live production data.

Our mission is to build the autonomous engine for the AI-native era of software development. We make AI systems self-improving in a continuous loop, with customer specific data.

TLDR


?? The workflow for fixing AI agents is fundamentally broken. It's a slow,
manual, and reactive process that burns engineering cycles and kills innovation. Arc replaces this broken loop with an autonomous platform.
When a production agent fails, Arc's autonomous platform:
?? Detects the failure pattern automatically.
?? Synthesizes a targeted test case and a perfect training example.
?? Optimizes the agent using the most efficient path, from prompt engineering to reinforcement-fine-tuning.
?? Validates the fix and presents it for one-click, human-approved deployment.
We are the autonomous operations layer for modern AI. We turn brittle agents into continuously improving systems.


Core Technical innovation: The workflow and orchestration is the product. We are productizing reinforcement learning on live telemetry data to power a system that autonomously generates its own reward function, self-improves, and is re-deployed into production through governed validation.



  The Shift: From Manual Pipelines to Autonomous Loops
We believe over the next 12 months, every digital interaction will become an agent invocation. Whether it's a customer support query, a transaction, a document approval, or an automated workflow, the result is 100x-1000x surge

in agent traces, tool calls, and failure events across every layer of the enterprise stack.
The market demands both maximum autonomy and complete observability forcing a tradeoff with traditional tools. As we move from single agents ?2024? to agent-to-agent systems ?2026??, existing observability infrastructure hits a fundamental ceiling.


The legacy playbook, staring at dashboards, manually triaging incidents, and stitching together ad-hoc scripts, cannot scale to meet the coming wave. The cost, complexity, and cognitive load is overwhelming even the most sophisticated engineering teams.

At the same time, enterprise customers are relentlessly focused on the pareto front of AI operations:
Cost: Can we build the most capital efficient software?
Performance: Can we deliver reliable, high-quality outcomes at scale?
Latency: Can we optimize for speed without sacrificing control or compliance?
The fundamental unit of value is a problem solved.
The next generation of AI infrastructure will not reward companies for how many dashboards they have, but for how few incidents reach a human at all.
As model capabilities continue to increase, the unlock is the quality of
orchestration and enablement:
The right algorithms, in the right combination, operationalized with extreme attention to detail.
Seamless integration, not marginal model gains.
A closed-loop, autonomous system where every failure makes the system smarter, not the engineer busier.

Just as CI/CD automated the automates the
         
loop for traditional software, Arc loop for AI.


The Three Eras of Applied AI

Era
Characteristic
The Bottleneck
Craft ?2017? 2022?
Hand-written prompts, one- off fine-tunes.
Doesn't scale beyond a single engineer's intuition.

Industrial ?2023? 2025?
Managed pipelines; dashboards for eval and monitoring.
The dashboard is a fire alarm, not a firefighter. An engineer still needs to manually put out the fire.

Post-Industrial
?2026??
Self-improving systems; continuous, automated remediation loops
Requires always-on, vendor-neutral control plane to manage the complexity.
We are building the infrastructure for this third era. We believe that production failures are not problems to be managed, but data to be learned from,

automatically.

  The Core Problem: The Broken Loop of Agent Reliability
Engineering teams spend more time debugging agents than deploying them.
Today, when a production AI agent fails, it triggers a broken, human-driven workflow that is the primary source of operational pain and reflective of how current workflows and systems are designed.

No one owns the full reliability loop because it crosses three organizational boundaries: MLOps, DevOps, and Product Engineering.

The Traditional Workflow: An engineer must manually orchestrate a multi- step process across siloed platforms:
Detect a failure in an observability tool (like Braintrust, Langsmith, Datadog, Arize, etc.)
Write a custom evaluation script in their evaluation Curate evaluation results
Refine their system prompt, agent configuration or trigger a fine-tuning job in a separate environment
Validate the result
Redeploy and manually update their CI/CD pipeline to deploy the fix.
This process is slow, error-prone, and creates significant operational overhead. This isn't a tools problem, it's an architecture problem.
The implication is engineers spend ?40% of their time on reliability instead of building features. We assume model diversity will only increase with the proliferation of small models, each with unique failure modes.

Our Customer: The Modern AI Engineering Lead
We are building for the most underserved and fastest-growing persona in the AI ecosystem.
The Persona: Our customer is Alex, the AI engineering lead at a growth-stage, Series A?D company. Alex and their small team ?1?5 engineers) are on the front lines, tasked with shipping and maintaining the AI agents that are supposed to revolutionize their business.
Core Job: To deliver reliable AI features that provide business value. They are measured on uptime, performance, and cost-efficiency.
Alex lives in the maintenance trap. It is now 100x easier to build a "demo- quality" AI agent, but the complexity of keeping it from failing in the real world has exploded. This has created a new class of developer whose primary job is firefighting.
Alex's team is caught in a costly, reactive Manual Correction Loop Primary Pains:
?? They are inundated with logs and alerts from their agents but lack an efficient way to prioritize and fix the root causes.
?? They don't want to be locked into a single cloud provider (like AWS or GCP? and need tools that work across their diverse stack.
?? They are being asked to do more with less and simply do not have the headcount to manually manage the entire agent lifecycle. They need automation to scale effectively.
"I want to build AI features, not babysit them. Give me something that just handles the operational mess so my team can actually innovate.?
Our Solution: An Autonomous Operations Platform
Arc turns production agent failures into fuel for continuous improvement, without adding more manual work.
What we do:
Arc is an autonomous engine that watches every agent interaction, detects failures, and then learns the optimal fix. It closes the loop from observation to

deployment-turning troubleshooting into a fully autonomous, auditable process.





This entire process is designed to be a virtuous cycle, transforming messy production data into a resilient, self-improving agent.

Here is how the loop functions today (under the hood)
?? Detect & Isolate: When a live Agent (v1.0? fails in the User Environment, our Tracing SDK streams the full interaction trace to our Interaction Store (ie. Failure-to-Fix Graph). A dedicated Observer & Failure

Classifier immediately identifies the failure pattern, clusters it with similar past events, and flags it for remediation in our Console.
?? Synthesize & Verify: This is our core IP. The flagged failure triggers two parallel synthesizers:
The Evaluation Synthesizer programmatically generates a targeted Eval Set, a precise, executable test case that codifies this specific failure. This ensures any proposed fix can be rigorously validated.
The Reward & Training Synthesizer generates a high-
quality Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Dataset, creating a "golden" example of the correct agent behavior.
?? Optimize & Validate: Once Arc has synthesized training and evaluation data from live agent failures, the Training & Validation Service takes over
a? How it works:
i? Agent as Policy: The agent itself is treated as a policy: given a prompt, it generates a full response (text, code, JSON, etc.) that we want to optimize.
ii? Reward Signal: Arc creates a dynamic, task-specific reward function. Instead of just asking the agent to copy the golden example dataset, it compares each generated response to the gold standard and scores it-+1 for a perfect match, ?1 for a total miss, and nuanced values in between (using semantic similarity and business rules).
iii? Policy Optimization: We use PPO to update the agent's parameters (e.g., via LoRA adapters). This fine-tunes how the agent decides what to do, making it much less likely to repeat the same failure.
iv? Validation: Before any new version goes live, Arc rigorously tests it against the full evaluation set-ensuring that the fix works and doesn't introduce new problems.
?? Deploy with Confidence: The validated Candidate v1.1 is published to the Model Registry and surfaced to the AI Engineer via the Deployment Service. The console provides a full report, the validation score, a diff of

the change, and a confidence score ensuring the engineer maintains full control and can deploy the improvement with a single click. Once approved, the new Agent v1.1 is rolled out, and the virtuous cycle continues.
This offline, human-in-the-loop process is our deliberate starting point. It allows us to build an incredibly robust and trustworthy reward model. As this model matures, it unlocks the next phase of our roadmap: enabling true online RL, where the agent can safely learn and adapt in real-time from live production traffic.

What's defensible about this system?
Live telemetry as ground truth: Arc's RL loop leverages live customer data, enabling the nuance of domain specificity to be embedded into our system.
Unified causal graph: Arc maps the full journey from agent intent to final outcome, across frameworks and deployment types, making "what works? discoverable and reusable for customers, which becomes a proprietary "Failure-to-Fix? graph.
True closed-loop automation: The system proposes, validates, and deploys fixes, autonomously, with transparency and auditability.
Vendor and model agnostic: Works across agent frameworks and cloud environments, letting customers own their stack without lock-in.
The Vision: We believe the future of AI operations is not humans staring at logs, but humans observing an autonomous system that finds, tests, and fixes failures on its own.

The Wedge: Structured Output Failures
Our initial focus on structured output failures is a deliberate first step into a much larger universe of agentic failure modes. The taxonomy of risks,

from memory poisoning and agent impersonation to Human-in-the-Loop bypass attacks and organizational knowledge loss are growing.
Why start with structured output?
?? It is the highest-frequency pain point: Nearly every team building tool- augmented agents experiences this daily. Across 30 major LLMs, JSON- schema violation rates span 0.23% (best performers like GPT?4o-mini) up to 46.6% ?DeepSeek Chat V3?, with a median failure rate of 8?17% ??1 error every 6?12 calls).


?? It is discrete and measurable: A fix is either valid JSON or it isn't. This allows us to prove the core mechanics of our autonomous detect- synthesize-optimize-validate loop in a clear and undeniable way.
?? It builds foundational trust: By reliably solving the most common and frustrating problem first, we earn the credibility to tackle more nuanced and higher-stakes failures. Every tool-augmented agent relies on perfectly structured output (typically JSON? to tell the executor which external API to call and with what parameters. In practice, malformed or non-compliant JSON is the single largest root cause of agent crashes and silent failures.

Our engine is architected to be extensible. Once we have perfected the autonomous remediation of output failures, the same core loop is designed to be adapted to address the full taxonomy of agentic risks, making Arc the single system of record for AI reliability.
Go-to-Market: How We Get This in the Hands of
Customers
TLDR? Build open source community ? validate core value prop with high-value design partners ? scale direct sales motions.
Now: Open-Source Wedge
Publish technical proof points of the methodology to drive open source community and research collaboration.
Asset: ?? Schema Reinforcement Learning for Failure Remediation We'll release the short paper, dataset, and model weights as the core CTA on June 25th.

Now: Pilot Partnerships
The Partners: Commitments from individual technical leads at Snowflake, NVIDIA, Palo Alto Networks, and Blackrock to serve as pilot partners and beta testers.
The Process:
?? Onboarding: We will manually instrument the Arc Tracing SDK into a single, high-pain agent within each partner's environment.
?? Taxonomy Mapping: Our primary goal is to work alongside them to map their unique agent failure taxonomy. We start with structured output, but we will use our tools to discover and classify their other failure modes (e.g., incorrect tool-args, context-ignore).
?? Manual Remediation Loop: Initially, our team will manually run the
loop for them. We will deliver newly trained agents

weekly and provide a detailed report on the performance improvements.
The Goal: To prove that our core loop can deliver quantifiable ROI in complex, real-world enterprise environments. We are validating our ability to solve their specific pain and building the case studies that will fuel our broader sales motion.
Conversion Goal: After the first month of delivering tangible value, we will convert these design partners into our first paying customers for the fully automated, self-serve Arc platform with the primary selling point of the failure taxonomy we've collected from their agents.

Next: Parallel Path Scaling
1. Mid-Market Sales Motion ?Top-Down):
The Playbook: We will use the detailed failure taxonomies and ROI metrics from our design partners to build a targeted, outbound sales motion. We will approach engineering leaders at Series B?D companies in high- consequence domains (fintech, healthcare, security) to start.
The Value Prop: "We saved the team at Blackrock 15 hours a week on agent firefighting and increased their trade-clearing agent's accuracy by 12%. We can do the same for you."
The Land & Expand Model: We land with a single agent team and expand across the organization as we prove our value. Our defensibility grows with every new failure taxonomy we map, as our system becomes an expert on that organization's specific operational challenges.
2. Open-Source & Community Motion ?Bottoms-Up):
The Strategy: This is a long-term play to build network effects around a developer community. We will be very deliberate here to avoid over- committing our small team.
Initial Steps:

Open-Source the SDK? The	tracing SDK will be fully open-
source to remove all friction for adoption.

Release More Tools, Not the Full Platform: We will open-source specific, high-value components that solve a single problem well. Next on the roadmap is a standalone Python library for the
that can programmatically generate test cases from a failure trace.
Key Assumptions & Dependencies
*Note: all of this is underpinned with our core values of extreme attention to detail, speed as the moat, and to productize the latest research

Dependency
Key Assumption & What We Believe
1. Market Pain & Urgency
The "Maintenance Trap" is a top-3 priority for AI engineering leads, and they are actively seeking solutions beyond better dashboards.

2. Willingness to Pay
The value of automating the remediation loop is high enough that teams will allocate budget for a dedicated platform, rather than trying to build it themselves.

3. Technical Scalability
Our core architecture ( detect-synthesize-optimize ) can generalize from JSON failures to the broader, more complex failure taxonomies of our design partners.

4. Layered Defensibility
The proprietary dataset we build (the "Failure-to-Fix Graph") creates a compounding advantage that makes our system smarter and harder for competitors to replicate over time.
Market Positioning: Competitive Dynamics
  Observability Giants: Selling Better Dashboards, Not Fewer Fires
The traditional observability vendors ?Datadog, New Relic, etc.) make money by selling monitoring to humans. Their pricing models tell the story: Datadog charges per host and per user seat for incident management. The more human operators and dashboards a customer needs, the better for their business.
An autonomous system that reduces the need for humans to stare at graphs threatens that model. These companies are rooted in APM, built to collect metrics and trigger alerts for people to investigate. They excel at reactive alerting, not at automated remediation. Even as they add "AIOps? features, it's mostly about surfacing insights faster, not fixing issues outright. For example, New Relic's AI can group alerts and suggest root

causes, but it ultimately kicks issues to PagerDuty or ServiceNow for humans to handle the fix. Datadog has introduced automated runbook triggers ("auto-remediation workflows?) in its incident product, but these handle only routine actions like restarting a service.

Observability giants are incentivized to sell ever-more sophisticated fire alarms and dashboards to ops teams, rather than building the autonomous fire suppression system. Their legacy architectures and revenue loops tie them to the idea of a human-in-the-loop at all times, which leaves a gap for a truly closed-loop solution.
ML?Native Platforms: Powerful Workbenches for Experts
A second category of players ?LangSmith, Weights & Biases, Arize, etc.) approach reliability as a tooling problem for ML engineers. These platforms are essentially workbenches - they offer extensive capabilities, but only in the hands of a skilled craftsperson. Weights & Biases ?W&B? is branded as an "AI developer platform,? historically serving machine learning practitioners building and tuning models . Its new LLM toolset still assumes a scientific workflow: you instrument your code to log every model interaction, run many experiments, and manually curate evaluations to improve the system. This is fantastic for an AI specialist with time to iterate in Jupyter notebooks or a web UI ? but consider our persona, the overburdened AI Product Manager. They don't have bandwidth to become a prompt-tweaking, model-debugging expert using half a dozen tools.
ML-native platforms empower the expert user but introduce workflow friction for everyone else. They assume an idealized user who knows exactly what to look for and what to do - whereas many teams have just one "Alex? who actually needs the platform to do the heavy lifting.

Many ML-native tools are narrow in their worldview, optimized for a particular workflow (be it LangChain, a certain model type, or a specific stage of development). They aren't incentivized to solve end-to-end problems for

a generalist user. The result is that less-specialized teams find these tools powerful but cumbersome - they get a better wrench or microscope, but not an autopilot to actually fix issues in production.
Point Solutions: Growing, But Crowded
Agent Evaluation solutions like Braintrust, Freeplay and ConfidentAI, AgentOps, and others are emerging as growing platforms. Each is laser- focused on one slice of the problem - and many do that slice exceptionally well.
For a customer, however, adopting point solutions can feel like assembling a jigsaw puzzle: you get a piece here and a piece there, but you have to integrate them. Each of these tools addresses one step in the overall reliability workflow (be it prompt tuning, evaluation, or runtime monitoring), but none alone addresses the entire lifecycle from problem detection to automated fix.

Relying on many point solutions forces customers to become the integrator, which is exactly the pain point Arc is targeting. Our thesis is that reliability is an end-to-end problem - the true moat comes from solving the entire workflow.
The Data Wars Are Here
AWS, Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, Anthropic - each has strategic reasons to keep users within their walled gardens. Every major platform vendor is trying to leverage AI to strengthen cloud/platform lock-in.
We deliberately choose to be framework-agnostic and cloud-agnostic because customers are increasingly wary of getting stuck on one platform. Especially in the mid-market (where resources are limited and flexibility is paramount), companies fear that tying themselves to a single vendor's AI stack could leave them stranded as the tech evolves. Today's best model might be from OpenAI, but six months from now it could be from Anthropic

or an open-source project - who wants to rebuild their entire pipeline because of vendor constraints?

The customer priority is AI stack portability and building modular infrastructure to quickly pivot to the strongest model capabilities for their use case.
Arc is essentially building this neutral control plane for autonomy: we integrate with all the major clouds and model APIs, and we have no incentive to push one over the other. Our promise is one of customer alignment. We win when the customer's system is reliable on their preferred stack.
The Thesis: Closed-Loop, Agnostic, Guided Autonomy

The fundamental unit of value in agent reliability is a problem solved (or prevented), not an alert, not a metric, not a model output. We measure our success in incidents avoided or resolved without human toil.
Our product is the end-to-end workflow itself. In Arc's worldview, when an issue arises, it should be diagnosed and remediated by the platform itself whenever possible. The loop only pulls in a human ?Alex) for "guided autonomy,? i.e., when the system needs a policy decision or a sanity check to stay aligned with business goals. We give the user the ability to set the guardrails and the high-level strategy (e.g. what actions are permissible, what success criteria are), and then the autonomous workflows carry out the busywork. Over time, as trust is built, Arc can handle more and more cases independently, and the user moves to a supervisory role.
Because Arc sits across all parts of the stack and across many customers, we will accumulate a unique dataset about failure modes and fixes. We'll see patterns that no siloed tool can see. For instance, we might learn that a surge in a certain metric plus a certain LLM output pattern plus a recent code deploy equals a known type of failure - and we'll fix it automatically for the next

customer who hits that pattern. Over time, Arc's autonomous brain gets smarter with each incident it handles. We are building a corpus of "what went wrong and how to fix it? that is proprietary ?Failure ? Outcome Graph). It's analogous to how self-driving car companies gain an edge by having driven millions of miles - we will have "seen? and handled a huge variety of AI system hiccups. That continuous learning makes Arc increasingly robust.
We are building the autonomous, agnostic reliability platform precisely at a time when the world of AI operations is getting more complex, more fragmented, and in need of a unifying solution.


The vision for Arc is to build the missing piece of the AI-native stack. We believe every failure should make a system stronger, not an engineer more frustrated. We are building the engine to make that a reality for every developer.
