The application of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) constitutes a rapidly advancing research area. While MLLMs extend Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle diverse modalities such as vision, audio, and video, enabling robust reasoning
across multimodal inputs remains challenging. This paper provides a systematic review of recent advances
in RL-based reasoning for MLLMs, covering key algorithmic designs, reward mechanism innovations, and
practical applications. We highlight two main RL paradigms, value-model-free and value-model-based methods, and analyze how RL enhances reasoning abilities by optimizing reasoning trajectories and aligning
multimodal information. Additionally, we provide an extensive overview of benchmark datasets, evaluation
protocols, and current limitations, and propose future research directions to address challenges such as sparse
rewards, inefficient cross-modal reasoning, and real-world deployment constraints. Our goal is to provide a
comprehensive and structured guide to RL-based multimodal reasoning.

surpassing basic perceptual abilities but also developing sophisticated cognitive reasoning skills
that enable iterative reasoning through contextual understanding and self-correction. Inspired
by this, in-context learning (ICL) techniques [107, 113] have empowered LLMs with step-by-step
reasoning abilities, commonly referred to as the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning mechanism
[4, 104]. OpenAI’s o1 model [38] has demonstrated remarkable performance in solving reasoning
tasks, sparking widespread interest across domains in test-time scaling research. By leveraging
additional computation during inference time to conduct "slow thinking" [42], it further enhances
the accuracy of responses to complex problems.
Inspired by the extensive research on the CoT in LLMs, reasoning tasks in multi-modal large
language models (MLLMs) [2, 91, 100] have experienced rapid advancements. Typical methods
include Best-of-N, Beam Search, and Monte Carlo Tree Search [8, 118, 125]. These approaches rely on
intricate search mechanisms to generate large volumes of reasoning data and utilize supervised finetuning (SFT) to enable models to acquire autonomous reasoning capabilities. With the advancement
of reinforcement learning (RL) theory and technology, DeepSeek R1 [31] demonstrates how large
language models can autonomously develop complex reasoning abilities through simple rulebased incentive mechanisms and lightweight reinforcement learning (GRPO [81]) algorithms. This
method enables LLMs to naturally exhibit "Aha Moment" without explicit supervision, characterized
by self-reflection and spontaneous increases in response length during training. Recent studies
[36, 61, 72, 147] have extended this approach to MLLMs and applied it to areas such as object
recognition [61], semantic segmentation [58], and video analysis [86]. These methods significantly
enhance MLLMs’ capabilities with limited training data, achieving performance comparable to
SFT in in-domain tests while outperforming SFT models in out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluations.
However, this rapid progress, as illustrated in Figure 1, presents significant challenges to researchers.
Although RL-based methods are effective, most of them adhere to text-based thinking practices,
neglecting the critical role of other modalities in multimodal scenarios. Moreover, current RLbased reasoning methods primarily rely on rule-based reward functions with verifiable answers,
overlooking broader general-scenario problems where verifiable answers are unavailable.

Although many existing surveys focus on MLLMs reasoning [50, 105], none of them specifically
address the issue of RL-based reasoning for MLLMs. To fill this gap, we provide a comprehensive
and systematic review of reasoning methods for RL-based MLLMs, offering a structured analysis
of technological advancements, methodologies, practical applications, and future directions. Our
goal is to provide researchers with a thorough and systematic guide to identifying appropriate
methods in the rapidly evolving field of MLLM reasoning, thereby promoting further innovation
and progress in this dynamic area. We first introduce the background of MLLMs, CoT reasoning, and
reinforcement learning in Section 2. Then, we review key RL algorithm designs and optimizations
for both LLMs and MLLMs in Section 3. Next, we survey RL-based reasoning methods for MLLMs,
covering algorithmic strategies, reward mechanisms, and benchmark evaluations in Section 4,
Section 5 and Section 6. Finally, Section 7 discuss current limitations and future research directions
in this rapidly evolving field in.
This paper addresses RL-based reasoning for MLLMs from four key perspectives:
• Core Designs of RL in LLMs/MLLMs : Analyze value-model-free and value-model-based
methods, focusing on their innovations in training efficiency, stability, and performance,
while discussing strengths, weaknesses, and optimization opportunities.
• Analysis of RL-Based Reasoning Methods : Examine the algorithmic frameworks, the design of reward functions including both accuracy-oriented and structure-oriented approaches,
and the strategies for integrating multiple modalities. Furthermore, emphasize how each of
these components contributes to addressing the core challenges of multimodal reasoning.
• Benchmark Datasets and Evaluation Protocols : Survey datasets and evaluation methods
for reasoning tasks, covering construction pipelines such as data sources and annotations, as
well as benchmarks spanning math, science, spatial, and interaction-based domains.
• Limitations and Future Directions : Highlight unresolved challenges such as sparse
rewards, inefficient trajectories, and cross-modal coordination. Meanwhile, propose future
directions including hierarchical reward modeling, vision-guided CoT, and lightweight RL
frameworks for real-world use.

Background and Preliminary
Multi-Modal Large Language Models and MM-COT

Despite the impressive zero-shot/few-shot reasoning performance of LLMs in most Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, they are limited to understanding only discrete textual information. In
contrast, models for other modalities are capable of integrating information from various modalities
such as images, audio, and video [2, 44, 86], but often fall short in reasoning capabilities. Given this
complementarity, the integration of LLMs with other specialized models has led to the emergence
of multimodal large language models. Representative examples include open-source models such as
Qwen-VL [2, 100], Intern-VL [15, 150], LLaVA [52, 53], and Valley [66, 112], as well as closed-models
like GPT-4o [37] and Gemini [89, 90]. These MLLMs leverage LLMs as the core cognitive engine,
demonstrating exceptional capabilities such as strong language generation, zero-shot transfer, and
ICL. At the same time, foundational models for other modalities empower a variety of multimodal
tasks by providing high-quality representations for non-textual data. In summary, mainstream
MLLMs typically follow a consistent architecture: they process multimodal embeddings or tokens
through a decoder structure, generating context-aware outputs autoregressively. Some studies have
attempted to enable MLLMs to handle arbitrary modality conversions [2, 119], further advancing
the development of "anything-to-anything" paradigm models.
CoT is a technique that encourages models to generate intermediate reasoning steps 𝑆 =
(𝑠 1, . . . , 𝑠𝑛 ) before arriving at the final answer 𝐴. In the context of multimodal reasoning tasks,

MM-CoT into two distinct scenarios: one that relies solely on linguistic information and another
that integrates multimodal signals beyond textual content. The former aims to solve tasks involving
multi-modal inputs using purely text-based CoT, while the latter emphasizes the integration of
given, retrieved, or generated multi-modal information within the MM-CoT itself. Since most
popular MLLMs still struggle to generate images or other modalities, recent advancements in
RL-based reasoning have primarily concentrated on the generation of text-only CoT.

Reinforcement Learning

2.2.1 Policy Optimization Methods. Reinforcement Learning is a fundamental approach in machine
learning where an agent learns to interact with an environment by taking actions, receiving
rewards, and updating its policy to maximize long-term returns. Reinforcement Learning from
Human Feedback (RLHF) [3], leveraging algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
[80], guides model behavior to enhance the alignment, coherence, and utility of generated responses.
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). PPO optimizes LLMs by maximizing the following surrogate
objective:

hyperparameter 𝜀 plays a critical role in stabilizing training by introducing a clipping mechanism. 𝐴𝑡 ,
computed using Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) [79], represents the advantage function
based on a reward model 𝑅 and a learnable critic model.
In recent years, RL has increasingly been applied to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs
[31, 91]. By treating reasoning token generation as a Markov Decision Process, models are trained
to maximize the expected return of reasoning paths, guiding optimization toward more structured
and coherent reasoning trajectories. In PPO, both the policy and critic models must be trained
simultaneously, which imposes significant computational demands when model parameters or
token counts are large. To reduce the resource consumption of PPO while stabilizing the training
process, some studies have begun exploring ways to simplify the PPO training pipeline.
REINFORCE Leave-One-Out (RLOO). RLOO [1] omits the use of a critic model and GAE , instead directly employing the Monte Carlo method to compute the baseline. Specifically, for each
query 𝑥, the model generates 𝐺 responses {𝑜 1, 𝑜 2, . . . , 𝑜𝐺 } and calculates a score for each response
{𝑟 1, 𝑟 2, . . . , 𝑟𝐺 }. RLOO uses a leave-one-out baseline to reduce the variance in policy gradient
estimation, with the advantage estimate computed as follows:

𝐴(𝑖) = 𝑟 (𝑖) −

1 ∑︁
𝑟 ( 𝑗),
𝐺 − 1 𝑗≠𝑖

𝑖 = 1, . . . , 𝐺 .

(4)

By modeling the entire process as a bandit problem, this method treats the entire response as an
action, discarding the token-level rewards used in PPO and instead relying solely on sequence-level
rewards. Although this method introduces higher variance, the authors consider it acceptable given
the strong performance of pre-trained models.
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). GRPO [81] eliminates the need for the critic model
by directly comparing generated response groups. Its optimization objective is defined as:
J𝐺𝑅𝑃𝑂 (𝜃 ) = E[𝑞 ∼ 𝑃 (𝑄), {𝑜𝑖 }𝐺

𝐺 𝑖=1

𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 (𝑜𝑖 |𝑞)
where 𝜀 and 𝛽 are hyperparameters, 𝐴𝑖 is the advantage derived from relative rewards within each
group, and 𝜋𝑟𝑒 𝑓 is the reference model for computing KL divergence. The core idea of GRPO is to
evaluate the relative quality of multiple candidate responses within a group. For a question 𝑞, GRPO
generates 𝐺 distinct responses {𝑜 1, 𝑜 2, . . . , 𝑜𝐺 } using 𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 , computes their rewards {𝑟 1, 𝑟 2, . . . , 𝑟𝐺 }
via a reward function, and calculates normalized scores to simulate PPO’s advantage function:
𝐴𝑖 =

𝑟𝑖 − mean({𝑟 1, . . . , 𝑟𝐺 })
std({𝑟 1, . . . , 𝑟𝐺 })

(6)

This approach not only reduces reliance on external critic models but also enhances the model’s
ability to distinguish high-quality from low-quality outputs, mitigating hardware constraints for
reasoning in generating long CoT for self-reflection and correction. Building on this, DeepSeek
R1 employs verifiable rewards to optimize task models for objectives with objectively verifiable
results, eliminating the need for intermediate reward modeling. Examples include mathematical
problem-solving, coding challenges, and domains with well-defined correctness criteria. This
method addresses reward hacking and establishes a foundational paradigm for RL-based reasoning.

2.2.2 Reward Mechanisms. To effectively guide model behavior during inference, particularly in
complex reasoning tasks, two types of reward mechanisms are commonly used: Outcome Reward
Mechanisms (ORM), which focus on the correctness of final outputs, and Process Reward Mechanisms (PRM), which emphasize the quality of intermediate reasoning steps. These mechanisms
offer distinct advantages and pose different challenges in model training and alignment.
Outcome Reward Mechanisms. ORM primarily focus on evaluating an agent based on the final
outcome or result achieved after executing a sequence of actions. These mechanisms typically
assess policy performance according to the terminal state of the task or the total accumulated
reward throughout the process. The reward signals in such settings are generally sparse and
delayed, providing feedback only upon task completion or successful attainment of the final goal.
In the context of model reasoning tasks, ORM refers to assessing and optimizing the model based
on the correctness of its final output. The reward is thus conditioned solely on the correctness
of the answer, without regard for the model’s intermediate reasoning behavior. For instance, in
mathematical problem-solving or question answering tasks, the model receives a positive reward
only when the final answer is correct [31, 81]. Due to its simplicity and the absence of complex
reward model training, ORM has become a widely adopted strategy for RL-based reasoning in
LLMs and MLLMs. However, ORM inherently suffers from the temporal credit assignment problem,
where the agent struggles to discern which specific actions contributed positively or negatively to
the final outcome [87]. This issue is particularly pronounced in environments with long temporal
horizons or high-dimensional action spaces, where it significantly impedes learning efficiency.
Furthermore, the sparse and delayed nature of the reward signal can lead to low sample efficiency
and unstable gradient updates during training.
Process Reward Mechanisms. In contrast to ORM, PRM place emphasis on evaluating the model’s
intermediate behaviors during the reasoning process, thereby encouraging the incremental formation of coherent and logically sound CoT. Rather than focusing solely on task completion, PRM
rewards intermediate behaviors that align with desirable reasoning patterns, even in cases where
the final objective is not fully achieved. In model inference tasks, this approach is commonly
employed to promote the generation of logically consistent intermediate reasoning steps, plausible
deductive structures, or the use of credible sources from external knowledge bases. Recent research has proposed the incorporation of process-level reward signals—such as logical consistency,
informational completeness, or citation reliability for each reasoning step—into the fine-tuning
process, thereby improving model interpretability and enhancing user trust [25, 139]. Compared to
outcome-based rewards, process-level mechanisms offer finer-grained supervision, facilitating more
effective debugging and alignment of model behavior. Nevertheless, the design of process rewards
depends heavily on the accurate evaluation of intermediate reasoning steps, which poses significant
challenges for automation. Moreover, the absence of standardized and robust evaluation criteria
limits the scalability and generalizability of PRMs across diverse tasks and model architectures.
2.2.3 Training Efficiency. Improving training efficiency has become a critical focus in RL, particularly for real-world applications where computational resources and data are limited. Two
prominent strategies for enhancing training efficiency are curriculum reinforcement learning and
data-efficient learning techniques.
Curriculum reinforcement learning draws inspiration from the human learning process by
introducing tasks in a structured progression, starting from easier subtasks and gradually moving to
more complex ones [19, 69]. This staged training paradigm allows agents to accumulate knowledge
incrementally, leading to faster convergence and improved performance on challenging tasks. It is
particularly effective in environments with a clear task difficulty hierarchy.

Table 1. Differences in reasoning between LLMs and MLLMs

Data-efficient learning aims to maximize performance with minimal data. Two commonly adopted
approaches in this category include: (1) Prioritized Sampling [91]: Rather than uniformly sampling
from experience replay buffers, prioritized sampling selects transitions based on their learning
potential. This strategy focuses updates on informative samples, accelerating learning and improving policy quality. (2) High-Quality Samples [40]: Leveraging samples with higher utility—such as
trajectories with higher rewards or successful episodes—can significantly improve sample efficiency.
By concentrating training on more informative experiences, the agent learns more effectively while
reducing unnecessary computational overhead.
2.3

MLLM Reasoning

2.3.1 Differences and Similarities of Reasoning in LLMs and MLLMs. LLMs and MLLMs both employ
CoT-based reasoning to address complex tasks, with the core principle being the decomposition
of intricate problems into intermediate steps that guide the model toward a solution. Whether
prompted through textual examples for LLMs or multimodal inputs for MLLMs, the CoT process
remains fundamentally similar: the model systematically builds its reasoning based on prior steps,
providing transparency into its internal processes. This transparency is particularly valuable for
tasks like mathematical reasoning and code generation, where intermediate steps are crucial for
interpreting outputs. However, significant differences arise due to the types of inputs processed.
We summarize the main differences in CoT-based reasoning between LLMs and MLLMs in Table
1. In LLMs, CoT reasoning is confined to linguistic operations, involving logical deduction, arithmetic computation, or language clarification within a linear, text-centric framework. Conversely,
MLLMs engage in more dynamic and nonlinear reasoning by alternating between textual and other
modalities, such as visual perception. For instance, an MLLM might first reason about visual input
such as identifying "a blue car" in an image, and then integrate this with textual reasoning, such
as referencing typical car colors. This integration of modalities makes MLLMs’ CoT reasoning
inherently multidimensional but introduces challenges like cross-modal alignment, accurate incorporation of visual features, and avoiding modality bias. Grounding further differentiates the two, as
MLLMs anchor reasoning in real-world knowledge, such as visual objects or spatial relationships,
while LLMs rely solely on textual and abstract concepts. In summary, while both models leverage
CoT reasoning, LLMs excel in text-centered reasoning, whereas MLLMs expand this capability
by integrating multimodal data, necessitating tailored approaches that account for their unique
characteristics and enable nonlinear interactions across modalities in MM-CoT reasoning.

2.3.2 Methodologies in MLLM Reasoning. Inspired by the significant potential of reasoning in NLP
for solving complex language tasks [31, 38], recent studies have sought to enhance the reasoning
capabilities of MLLMs. Broadly, current MLLM reasoning methods fall into two main categories:
SFT-Based. The first method focuses on guiding models to generate high-quality CoT data that
adheres to specific steps. This can be achieved either through structured reasoning templates—such
as summaries, descriptions, logical reasoning, and conclusions—or by leveraging advanced search
algorithms. Notable examples include CoT prompting techniques [26, 145], planning-based approaches like Best-of-N [8, 118], Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) [117, 125], and Beam Search
[111, 126]. The generated CoT data is then utilized for SFT, enabling MLLMs to emulate high-quality,
structured reasoning. While this approach ensures the quality of CoT data and enables effective
integration of multi-modal information, it suffers from two key limitations: the labor-intensive
nature of CoT annotation and the risk of catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning.
RL-Based. The second category builds on the DeepSeek R1 [31] reinforcement learning paradigm,
which integrates large-scale RL with structured and outcome-driven reward functions. This framework enables large language models to automatically generate human-like reasoning processes
with remarkable complexity [61, 69, 74, 91, 144], eliminating the need for labor-intensive CoT
annotations. Additionally, it demonstrates strong generalization capabilities when handling OOD
data.However, current RL-based reasoning methods for MLLMs are primarily adapted from NLP,
with the generated reasoning trajectories predominantly presented in textual form, neglecting
interactions among diverse modalities such as images, videos, and audio in MM-CoT. Additionally,
the lack of effective reasoning path rewards in current RL-based reasoning often leads to CoT
outputs containing excessive redundant tokens.
2.3.3 SFT Memory, RL Generalization. SFT-based reasoning methods activate the model’s inherent
reasoning capabilities by identifying precise cognitive templates and directly constructing highquality reasoning trajectories. In contrast, RL-based approaches focus on leveraging RL to search
for optimal reasoning paths among numerous possibilities, treating the cultivation of reasoning
abilities as a process that requires extensive training to explore effective reasoning patterns. This
distinction is now widely recognized by the principle: SFT for memory, RL for generalization [17].
SFT offers strong inductive biases and precise knowledge injection, whereas RL unleashes the
model’s potential for abstract, adaptive, and robust reasoning under uncertainty. In the context
of MLLMs, where cross-modal alignment and dynamic understanding are critical, this dichotomy
becomes even more pronounced. Therefore, advancing RL-based reasoning adaptation techniques
tailored for multimodal scenarios is essential. This study contributes to this direction by providing
a comprehensive review and analysis of RL-based reasoning strategies in MLLMs.

Key Design and Optimization of RL Algorithms in LLMs/MLLMs

In RL for LLMs, methods can be classified into value-model-free such as GRPO [81] and valuemodel-based such as PPO [80] approaches, depending on whether a value model is learned [131].
While GRPO exhibits entropy collapse and instability, PPO faces challenges in long-chain reasoning.
Recent optimizations address these limitations, demonstrating improved performance in LLMs,
with potential applicability to MLLMs for enhanced training efficiency and stability.
3.1

Value-Model-Free

Value-model-free RL methods, such as GRPO [81], have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
LLM training by eliminating the need for value model computation. Instead, these approaches derive
advantages from trajectory-level rewards uniformly assigned to each token, providing stability

through group-based reward averaging. This characteristic proves particularly valuable in scenarios
where training value models is challenging, making value-model-free methods highly successful in
complex tasks like long-chain reasoning. While these methods offer implementation simplicity and
robustness, they also reveal fundamental limitations, such as entropy collapse and reward noise,
which recent advancements aim to address through novel optimization techniques.
3.1.1 DAPO. Dynamic sAmpling Policy Optimization (DAPO) [130] significantly improves the
model’s generation diversity and RL training efficiency by introducing an asymmetric clipping
strategy, a dynamic sampling mechanism, a token-level policy gradient loss, and extended reward
shaping. The optimization formula is as follows:

Clip-Higher Strategy. In GRPO, the clipping range is typically symmetric, i.e., 𝜖low = 𝜖high . However, this symmetric clipping strategy limits the exploration of low-probability tokens, potentially
leading to entropy collapse. To address this issue, DAPO introduces the Clip-Higher strategy in
Equation 7, decoupling the clipping bounds into 𝜖low and 𝜖high . This asymmetric clipping strategy
significantly increases the value of 𝜖high , thereby allowing for greater flexibility in enhancing
low-probability tokens.
Dynamic Sampling. To address the issue where gradient signals vanish if all samples in a batch
have accuracy rates of either 1 or 0, DAPO proposes a dynamic sampling strategy. By filtering out
samples with accuracy rates of 0 or 1, this strategy ensures that every batch contains samples with
valid gradient signals, represented as: 0 < |{𝑜𝑖 |is equivalent(𝑎, 𝑜𝑖 )}| < 𝐺 . The authors demonstrate
that dynamic sampling can substantially improve training efficiency.
Token-Level Policy Gradient Loss. GRPO computes loss at the sample level, averaging losses
across tokens within each sample before aggregating across different samples. This approach poses
challenges in long-chain reasoning scenarios, as the contribution of tokens in longer sequences to
the overall loss is diluted, making it difficult for the model to learn high-quality reasoning patterns.
To address this, DAPO proposes token-level policy gradient loss, which ensures that tokens in
longer sequences contribute gradients more fairly.
Overlong Reward Shaping. To address reward noise caused by improper shaping of truncated
samples, the Overlong Reward Shaping strategy introduces a progressive length-dependent penalty
mechanism. This adjusts rewards for truncated outputs and discourages excessive verbosity by
applying scaled punishments proportional to response lengths beyond a threshold, as follows:

𝑅length (𝑦) =




, 𝐿max − 𝐿cache < ∥𝑦 ∥ ≤ 𝐿max,
∥𝑦 ∥ > 𝐿max .

(8)

Where 𝐿cache is the buffer length, and 𝐿max is the maximum allowable output length for the model.
This mechanism significantly reduces the impact of reward noise, stabilizing the training process.

3.1.2 Dr.GRPO. Dr.GRPO [59] highlights that GRPO exhibits two biases: a response length bias
and a problem difficulty bias. Specifically, GRPO introduces normalization terms for output length
and reward standard deviation when computing the advantage function. These terms cause the
model to favor generating longer incorrect responses during optimization and assign different
weights to problems of varying difficulty. To address these issues, the proposed method eliminates
these biases by removing the normalization terms. The objective function of Dr.GRPO is as follows:
𝐽Dr.GRPO (𝜋𝜃 ) = E𝑞∼𝑝𝑄 ,{𝑜𝑖 }𝐺 ∼𝜋𝜃 (· |𝑞)

where the advantage function is defined as: 𝐴˜𝑖,𝑡 = 𝑅(𝑞, 𝑜𝑖 ) − mean({𝑅(𝑞, 𝑜 1 ), . . . , 𝑅(𝑞, 𝑜𝐺 )}).
Removal of Length Normalization. Compared to Equation 5, the authors remove the normalization
term ∥𝑜𝑖 ∥, which avoids the preference for longer incorrect responses and prevents the model from
generating increasingly lengthy errors.
Removal of Standard Deviation Normalization. For the advantage in Equation 5, the authors
eliminate the normalization term std({𝑅(𝑞, 𝑜 1 ), . . . , 𝑅(𝑞, 𝑜𝐺 )}). This removes the problem difficulty
bias, ensuring that problems of different difficulties are weighted equally during optimization.
3.1.3 CPPO. Completion Pruning Policy Optimization (CPPO) [51] is a novel approach designed to
accelerate the training of inference models based on GRPO. Compared to GRPO, CPPO introduces
several improvements, primarily focusing on reducing computational overhead, enhancing training
efficiency, and maintaining or even improving model performance. The objective function of CPPO
builds upon GRPO by incorporating pruning conditions, defined as follows:
"

𝜋𝜃 (𝑜𝑖,𝑡 |𝑞, 𝑜𝑖,<𝑡 )

(10)

where I = {𝑖 ∈ {1, . . . , 𝐺 } | |𝐴𝑖 | is among the top 𝑘 values}, meaning only the top 𝑘 completions
with the highest absolute advantage values are retained for gradient updates.
Strategy to Reduce Computational Overhead. CPPO identifies that the contribution of completions
to training is closely related to their absolute advantage values. Completions with low advantage
values contribute minimally to the training signal and may even introduce noise. Therefore, in
Equation (5), CPPO retains only the top 𝑘 completions with the highest absolute advantage values
for gradient updates, pruning the others to reduce redundant computations.
Dynamic Completion Allocation Strategy. While the completion pruning strategy reduces computational overhead, it causes underutilization of GPU resources. After pruning, the reduced number
of retained completions fails to fully leverage the parallel computing capabilities of GPUs. To
address this, CPPO combines the remaining pruned completions with high-quality completions
from new queries, filling the GPU processing pipeline. This ensures that each GPU device operates
at full capacity, thereby maximizing the utilization of GPU parallel computing power.

3.1.4 GPG. Group Policy Gradient (GPG) [18] eliminates the reliance on a reference model and
avoids KL divergence constraints by directly optimizing the original RL objective, thereby simplifying the training process and reducing computational costs. Additionally, GPG introduces
an Accurate Gradient Estimation (AGE) technique and a group reward normalization method,
effectively addressing issues related to advantage function and gradient estimation bias. These
innovations enhance training stability and performance.
Direct Optimization of the Original RL Objective. Methods like GRPO typically rely on surrogate
loss functions to approximate policy optimization. By contrast, GPG directly optimizes the original
RL objective, avoiding biases that surrogate loss functions might introduce. Its core optimization
objective is formulated as follows:
"

𝑖=1
𝑖=1 ∥𝑜 𝑖 ∥ 𝑖=1 𝑡 =1
where 𝐴𝑖,𝑡 is the normalized intra-group advantage function.
Elimination of the Reference Model. As shown in Equation 5, GRPO stabilizes training by using a
reference model and KL divergence constraints, whereas in Equation 11 GPG completely removes
these components. This results in a more concise loss function for GPG.
Addressing Advantage Function and Gradient Estimation Bias. GPG proposes an Accurate Gradient
Estimation (AGE) technique, which effectively resolves the issue of reward bias, formulated as:
Í𝐵
𝑔𝑖
𝐵
𝑔ˆ = 𝑖=𝑀+1 = 𝑔 · 𝛼, 𝛼 =

(12)
𝐵−𝑀
𝐵−𝑀
where 𝑀 represents the number of invalid samples (i.e., samples with zero gradients), and 𝛼 is a
dynamic adjustment factor used to correct gradient estimation bias.
3.2

Value-Model-Based

Value-model-based methods, exemplified by PPO,excel by enabling precise, step-wise credit assignment—an especially crucial feature for complex reasoning tasks, where minor errors at individual
steps can propagate into catastrophic failures. In contrast to the advantage estimates from Monte
Carlo methods in value-model-free approaches, a well-trained value model not only provides lowervariance token-level value estimates for enhanced training stability, but also exhibits inherent
generalization capabilities that improve online sample utilization efficiency[131]. While training
value models for long CoT reasoning remains challenging, recent studies have introduced innovative
optimization techniques that significantly improve both stability and overall performance.
3.2.1 ORZ. Open-Reasoner-Zero (ORZ) [35] demonstrates through extensive experiments that
by using the vanilla PPO algorithm combined with GAE (𝜆 = 1, 𝛾 = 1) and a simple rule-based
reward function, significant improvements in response length and benchmark performance can
be achieved without any KL regularization. Additionally, the authors highlight the importance
of increasing both the quantity and diversity of training data for enhancing model performance.
Compared to DeepSeek-R1-Zero, ORZ achieves comparable performance with only one-tenth of
the training steps.
3.2.2 VC-PPO. To enable traditional reinforcement learning algorithms like PPO to handle long
CoT tasks, Value-Calibrated PPO (VC-PPO) [132] introduces optimizations in two key areas: value
initialization bias and Decoupled-GAE.
, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: May 2025.

12

Guanghao Zhou, Panjia Qiu et al.

Value Initialization Bias. The value function 𝑉 (𝑠) in PPO is typically initialized using a reward
model during the early stages of training. However, this initialization method can lead to significant
bias, especially in long-sequence tasks. In the initial phase, since the reward model tends to
underestimate the scores of earlier tokens, the advantage function 𝐴𝑡 exhibits a positive bias when
estimating the contributions of these tokens. This bias encourages the policy to favor shorter
outputs, thereby undermining the model’s ability to generate long CoT sequences. To address this
issue, VC-PPO proposes Value Pretraining. By offline training the value model under a fixed policy
and using GAE with 𝜆 = 1.0 to ensure unbiased returns, the value model achieves a more accurate
estimation of expected rewards.
Decoupled-GAE. In long-sequence tasks, reward signals are often concentrated at the end of the
sequence. While conventional RL tasks typically employ GAE (𝜆 = 0.95) to mitigate variance in
cumulative rewards, RLHF fundamentally differs due to its trajectory-level reward signals. When
𝜆 < 1.0, these reward signals decay rapidly as they propagate backward through the sequence, which
significantly hampers the learning effectiveness of the value model. Decoupled-GAE addresses the
distinct variance reduction needs in RLHF by decoupling 𝜆 values for policy and value optimization.
Here, 𝜆 < 1.0 induces severe signal attenuation across long trajectories, making unbiased value
estimation (𝜆 = 1.0) essential while retaining 𝜆 = 0.95 for stable policy updates. This dual-𝜆
mechanism independently optimizes the bias-variance trade-off for each component, achieving
superior training efficiency over standard GAE methods, the formula is expressed as follows:
(Í
𝑇 −𝑡 −1 𝑙
𝜆 (𝑟𝑡 +𝑙 + 𝑉 (𝑠𝑡 +𝑙+1 ) − 𝑉 (𝑠𝑡 +𝑙 )) + 𝑉 (𝑠𝑡 ), 𝜆 < 1.0
𝑉target (𝑠𝑡 ) = Í𝑇𝑙=0
(13)
−𝑡 −1
𝑟𝑡 +𝑙 ,
𝜆 = 1.0
𝑙=0
With this design, the value model estimates expected rewards with reduced bias, while the policy
model accelerates convergence by reducing variance.
3.2.3 VAPO. Value-model-based Augmented Proximal Policy Optimization (VAPO) [131] enhances
the training stability of PPO in long-chain CoT reasoning tasks. It adopts several tricks from DAPO
[130] and VC-PPO [132], such as the Clip-Higher Strategy, Token-Level Policy Gradient Loss,
and Decoupled-GAE, while introducing Length-Adaptive GAE, Positive Example LM Loss, and
Group-Sampling to achieve balanced optimization across varying sequence lengths and mitigate
the issue of sparse rewards.
Length-Adaptive GAE. Building on the Decoupled-GAE method in VC-PPO, VAPO introduces
a Length-Adaptive GAE approach that dynamically adjusts the 𝜆 parameter to balance the biasvariance tradeoff for sequences of varying lengths. The specific formula is as follows:
1
𝜆policy = 1 − ,
(14)
𝛼𝑙
where 𝑙 denotes the sequence length and 𝛼 is a hyperparameter that controls the overall biasvariance trade-off. This formula ensures a more uniform distribution of the TD-error coefficients,
preventing the excessive decay of reward signals in long sequences.
Positive Example LM Loss. VAPO incorporates the Positive Example LM Loss, which leverages
the negative log-likelihood (NLL) of the correct answers to improve the utilization efficiency of
positive samples. The corresponding formula is:
LNLL (𝜃 ) = − Í

𝑖∥
∑︁ ∥𝑜
∑︁

𝑜𝑖 ∈𝑇 ∥𝑜 𝑖 ∥ 𝑜𝑖 ∈𝑇 𝑡 =1

log 𝜋𝜃 (𝑎𝑡 | 𝑠𝑡 ),

(15)

where 𝑇 denotes the set of correct answers, and ∥𝑜𝑖 ∥ represents the length of the sequence 𝑜𝑖 .

Group-Sampling. VAPO employs Group-Sampling to extract discriminative positive and negative
samples within the same prompt. It highlights that, given a fixed computational budget, reducing
the number of distinct prompts per batch and reallocating resources for repeated generations
improves performance. This is attributed to the introduction of richer contrastive signals, which
enhances the learning capability of the policy model.

RL-Based MLLM Reasoning

Deepseek-R1 [31] demonstrates that the reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be activated through
pure RL. Current RL-based reasoning methods model the reasoning process as a Markov Decision
Process (MDP). The core objective is to enhance the model’s reasoning capability by maximizing
the expected reward of the reasoning path 𝑆. Recently, researchers have begun exploring how
to apply the R1 training paradigm to MLLMs to further improve their reasoning performance in
complex tasks. In Table 2, we summarize the current research progress of reasoning methods based
on RL in the multimodal domain. In Section 4.1, we review recent efforts to adapt the R1 training
paradigm from LLMs to MLLMs, highlighting key challenges and corresponding solutions. Section
4.2 categorizes reward mechanisms in multimodal settings into Outcome-supervised and Processsupervised types. Section 4.3 discusses methods that enhance training efficiency and stability
through data utilization. Finally, Section 4.4 summarizes prevalent RLHF frameworks that support
rapid iteration of RL-based reasoning approaches.
4.1

RL Training Paradim: From LLM to MLLM

4.1.1 Standardized R1 Training Paradigm in LLM. The success of Kimi K1.5 [91] and DeepSeek R1
[31] in enhancing model reasoning capabilities through RL has driven the rise of the R1 training
paradigm in the field of model reasoning.
R1-Zero: Large Scale RL on Base Model. Kimi K1.5 [91] and Kimi-VL [92] employs a variant of the
online policy mirror descent (OPMD) algorithm [68, 95] to apply RL to MLLMs, thereby enhancing
their reasoning capabilities. Additionally, it adopts a length penalty mechanism to prevent the
model from overthinking. This represents a successful attempt in the direction of MLLM reasoning
based on RL. Meanwhile, DeepSeek R1 [31] introduces a key innovation by validating that RL with
Verifiable Reward (RLVR) is sufficient to effectively elicit reasoning capabilities in LLMs. The core
of RLVR lies in its rule-driven reward mechanism, which optimizes model performance efficiently
and reliably. Compared to traditional SFT and process supervision methods, RLVR demonstrates
significant advantages when handling verifiable tasks, such as mathematical problem-solving and
code generation: it eliminates the need for labor-intensive data generation and annotation while
significantly improving model performance with limited training data. Additionally, by avoiding
the complex training of reward models, RLVR effectively mitigates the issue of reward hacking.
Given an input question 𝑞, a policy model 𝜋𝜃 , and its generated response 𝑜, RLVR evaluates the
generated response using a verifiable reward function 𝑅(𝑞, 𝑜). The key role of this reward function
is to determine whether the generated output is correct and assign a binary score:
(
1, if 𝑜 == ground truth,
𝑅(𝑞, 𝑜) =
(16)
0, otherwise.
In DeepSeek R1, the reward model is designed as follows:
𝑅 = 𝑅𝑎𝑐𝑐 + 𝜆𝑅 𝑓 𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑡 ,

(17)

where 𝑅 𝑓 𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑡 evaluates whether the output of the policy model 𝜋𝜃 adheres to predefined template specifications. In DeepSeek R1, the template may require the output to follow the format

<think></think><answer></answer>, where <think></think> contains the model’s reasoning
process, and <answer></answer> includes the final result. On the other hand, 𝑅𝑎𝑐𝑐 focuses on
assessing whether the output in the <answer></answer> matches the ground truth. Through this
design, RLVR not only ensures the accuracy of the model’s output but also guides the model to
generate structured and interpretable reasoning content, thereby enhancing both performance and
explainability. In this survey, we refer to the method of using only the format reward and accuracy
reward during the RL phase, as defined in Equation 17, as the R1 training paradigm.
R1: RL for Reasoning with Cold Start. While RL has shown promise in improving the reasoning
abilities of LLMs, relying solely on large-scale RL is insufficient for robust reasoning development.
A fundamental challenge is that reinforcement learning algorithms often require a reasonably good
initialization to function effectively. In reasoning tasks, the combinatorial nature of the action space
makes it difficult to define intermediate rewards. Consequently, without a meaningful starting
policy, exploration becomes inefficient, leading to excessively sparse rewards. This frequently
causes training to collapse into trivial or degenerate behaviors. Cold-start methods address this
challenge by providing initial scaffolding, including techniques such as curriculum design, synthetic
demonstrations, weak supervision, or structured exploration, to bootstrap the model into a regime
where RL can be effectively applied. DeepSeek R1 collected thousands of cold-start data to finetune the base model, enhancing the readability of reasoning CoT and the potential for RL. Thus,
successful reasoning training typically involves a hybrid approach: cold start strategies to seed
useful reasoning behaviors, followed by RL to refine and optimize them over time.
4.1.2 R1 Training Paradim for MLLM. Inspired by the design of format reward and accuracy reward
mechanisms in Equation 17 within DeepSeek R1, researchers began attempting to transfer this
successful experience to multimodal tasks.
MLLM-R1-Zero. MedVLM-R1 [72] extended the DeepSeek R1 training paradigm to visual questionanswering (VQA) tasks in the medical domain, guiding the model to answer medical multiplechoice questions through explicit reasoning paths, thereby improving prediction accuracy and
OOD generalization performance. Similarly, VisualThinker-R1-Zero [147] and MM-Eureka [69]
successfully replicated DeepSeek R1’s long CoT characteristics, including the "Aha Moment,"
self-reflection mechanisms, and dynamic adjustment of response length, in spatial reasoning
and mathematical VQA tasks, respectively. These features demonstrate that the experience of
DeepSeek R1 can be effectively transferred to complex multimodal reasoning tasks. OThink-MR1
[62] improved the widely used GRPO algorithm by introducing dynamic weighting for the KL
divergence term, balancing exploration in the early training stages with exploitation in later stages.
To filter data with appropriate difficulty levels for RL training, ThinkLite-VL [103] proposes a sample
selection method based on MCTS. This method quantifies the difficulty of each sample by the
number of iterations required for the VLM to solve the problem. Despite these efforts achieving the
application of the R1 training paradigm in multimodal tasks, they remain constrained by Equation
17 format rewards and accuracy rewards, somewhat neglecting the unique characteristics of tasks
in the multimodal domain.
MLLM-R1. To improve the stability of the RL training process and the upper limit of the model’s
inference performance, some methods have begun constructing multi-modal SFT data to coldstart the base model. Vision-R1 [36] first leverages VLM and DeepSeek R1 to construct reasoning
cold-start data and performs SFT. Subsequently, it employs Progressive Thinking Suppression
Training (PTST), a staged RL strategy that incrementally extends the length of CoT reasoning
while mitigating overthinking from the early stages. Due to the relative scarcity of image-text data
compared to pure text data, LMM-R1 [74] proposes a two-stage training strategy to make efficient

use of textual CoT data: the first stage involves RL training on pure text data to enhance MLLM’s
foundational text reasoning abilities, while the second stage incorporates image-text data to further
improve the model’s generalization capabilities. R1-Onevision [124] highlights that long reasoning
paths may cause the model to overlook visual information. In the SFT stage, R1-Onevision constructs
a reasoning dataset incorporating formalized image descriptions. By standardizing the model’s
reasoning paths, it enables the model to actively integrate multimodal information during the
reasoning process. In the RL stage, the model’s reasoning capabilities and generalization are further
strengthened. Skywork R1V [128] proposes a lightweight R1 paradigm training method to alleviate
the high consumption of hardware resources. This approach combines a visual encoder with a
reasoning-capable LLM backbone through a lightweight visual projection module. The module
is iteratively trained using SFT and the R1 paradigm to enhance the reasoning performance of
MLLMs. Unlike cold-starting with SFT, Skywork R1V2 [108] employs MPO for model cold-starting
to address the issue where SFT undermines the performance of subsequent reinforcement learning
or reasoning processes. Additionally, a Selective Sample Buffer (SSB) mechanism is designed to
address the "vanishing advantage" problem in GRPO. To address the diversity of mathematical
problems, Reason-RFT [88] designed customized reward mechanisms for various problems. Each
mechanism is tailored to the unique characteristics of its respective problem category, ensuring
precise and fair evaluations.
MLLM-R1 for Other Modalities. Beyond image-text interactions, some research has explored
applying the R1 training paradigm to tasks involving other modalities. R1-Omni [144] conducted
preliminary explorations in mixed-modality tasks involving video and audio. It first performs SFT
cold-start with a small amount of reasoning data, then utilized the R1 training paradigm to explore
the application of reasoning models in emotion recognition tasks. Spatial-R1 [70] extends the R1
training paradigm to the field of video spatial reasoning. Additionally, R1-AQA [44], SARI [109]
and R1-Zero-VSI [49] have conducted a series of reinforcement learning-related explorations in
audio understanding and video spatial reasoning tasks, respectively. These efforts provide new
insights for the further development of multimodal reasoning.
4.2

Reward Mechanism Design for Multimodal Perception

4.2.1 Outcome-supervised reward Mechanism. Outcome-supervised reward mechanisms represent
an advancement in aligning RL with complex, multimodal tasks by leveraging task-specific and
cross-modal feedback. These mechanisms not only enhance model performance through structured
and hierarchical rewards but also pave the way for more interpretable and generalizable reasoning
across diverse modalities. We summarize the reward functions of different reward strategies in

Task-Oriented Reward Strategy. Given the complexity and diversity of multimodal tasks, recent
studies have explored reward designs that leverage the intrinsic properties of each modality to
broaden the applicability of RL. Visual-RFT [61] targets fundamental computer vision problems
such as image classification, object detection, and image-text grounding, introducing task-specific
visual rewards. All of these rewards are based on the final prediction accuracy, providing clear
label supervision signals within the visual modality. Seg-Zero [58] extends this concept to the field
of visual segmentation. In addition to pixel-level IoU and L1 distance metrics used for evaluating
segmentation quality, this method introduces model-generated CoT responses as part of the output,
enabling partial supervision of the reasoning trajectory. Similarly, VLM-R1 [82] designs reward
functions for referring expression comprehension and open-vocabulary object detection. To address
the multi-agent attributes in visual perception tasks, Perception-R1 [129] formulates the reward
matching problem as a bipartite graph matching task and employs the Hungarian algorithm [43] to

maximize the overall reward. This ensures that each predicted attribute is accurately matched to
its corresponding ground truth, thereby optimizing the reward calculation process. R1-SGG [14]
and VideoChat-R1 [48] both employ modular reward functions, tailored for structured scene graph
generation and spatiotemporal video tasks, respectively. They design composite rewards—covering
format, node/edge alignment, IoU, and task-specific correctness—to guide model outputs toward
structured, temporally grounded responses. In contrast, TinyLLaVA-Video-R1 [142] applies a
lightweight reward scheme combining answer correctness, format adherence, and reasoning length,
enabling small models to exhibit interpretable rationales under limited supervision. In addition
to designing rewards for single-modality characteristics, some methods have begun to consider
cross-modal interactions, representing a transitional phase in the broader shift from single-modality
to multi-modality reward modeling.
Cross-Modal Interaction Reward Strategy. To address the non-linear interactions in multimodal
reasoning, recent studies assign modality-specific rewards to promote more active cross-modal
interactions. Q-Insight [47] employs GRPO to jointly optimize score accuracy and distortion classification, enabling perceptual reasoning with minimal supervision and strong zero-shot generalization.
Building on this, VLAA-Thinker [9] introduces a mixed reward module combining rule-based and
open-ended signals to guide adaptive, realistic reasoning. Relation-R1 [45] targets complex visual
relations by designing Binary and N-ary Relation Rewards, emphasizing visual-semantic grounding
over linguistic bias. To counter overthinking, Fast [115] introduces a complexity-aware thinking
reward and adaptively adjusts the KL coefficient based on visual and semantic difficulty. Some
methods extend RL to temporal reasoning via audio–visual modeling. Video-R1 [27] introduces
a reward based on temporal consistency by comparing predicted and ground-truth frame orders,
guiding causal inference across time. While the reward remains output-based and coarse-grained,
it marks a step toward RL-driven multimodal temporal understanding.

Strategies.

As reinforcement learning extends to spatial reasoning, reward design must accommodate not
only semantic alignment across modalities but also reasoning over actions, layouts, and 3D constraints. MetaSpatial [73] introduces a multi-tier reward system for 3D scene generation, combining
format validation, physics-based verification, and GPT-4o-driven perceptual scoring. This hierarchical structure enables dense, cross-modal feedback and supports grounded scene generation.
GFlowVLM [40] further advances process-level modeling using GFlowNets to sample reasoning
trajectories with probabilities aligned to structured rewards. It employs Trajectory-, Subtrajectory, and Detailed-Balanced losses to optimize coherence at both local and global levels, enabling
fine-grained reward propagation throughout multimodal inference.
Curriculum-Based Reward Strategy. In addition to adopting the standard R1 training paradigm,
Curr-ReFT [19] employs a three-stage curriculum consisting of binary classification, multiplechoice selection, and open-ended question answering, with each stage guided by task-specific
rewards to progressively build reasoning ability. Embodied-R [143] also adopts a staged training
approach, introducing different weights for 𝜔 across training phases. Additionally, it incorporates
a logical consistency reward to align the reasoning process with the final answer in spatial tasks.
NoisyRollout [55] enhances exploration by mixing clean and noisy visual inputs, using a noise
annealing schedule to guide training from early diversity to stable convergence.

4.2.2 Process-Supervised Reward Mechanism. To mitigate sparse feedback and improve structural
reasoning, recent studies adopt process-based rewards to enhance logical coherence. R1-VL [139]
serves as a representative example of this direction. It introduces Step-wise Group Relative Policy
Optimization (StepGRPO), an online reinforcement learning framework that incorporates two structurally grounded reward components designed to operate over the reasoning process: StepRAR
evaluates whether the model’s output includes key intermediate reasoning steps, while StepRVR
assesses the logical coherence and completeness of the overall reasoning chain. These rewards are
anchored at intermediate states and span the entire vision–language–reasoning trajectory, significantly improving the model’s ability to maintain logical consistency in complex tasks. Similarly,
ChestX-Reasoner [25] introduces a process reward based on clinical reports, evaluating the factual
accuracy of intermediate reasoning steps to enhance diagnostic coherence and reasoning quality.
4.3

Training Efficiency and Stability

Training efficiency and stability are critical in the development of robust reasoning models, particularly in complex multimodal settings. By leveraging strategies such as curriculum learning, sample
efficiency optimization, and techniques to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, researchers can enhance
both the speed and reliability of model training while preserving previously acquired knowledge.
4.3.1 Curriculum Learning. Curriculum learning is a training strategy that emulates the human
learning process by organizing tasks in an order of increasing difficulty, allowing models to first
acquire basic skills before advancing to more complex reasoning abilities. In RL, especially for
multimodal reasoning tasks, curriculum learning helps mitigate training instability and accelerates
convergence by providing structured, progressively challenging learning stages. Kimi K1.5 [91]
adopts curriculum and prioritized sampling to expose the model to increasingly difficult examples
while focusing on weak areas, enhancing overall training efficiency. Curr-ReFT [19] introduces
difficulty-aware reward shaping to stage the learning process, facilitating stable reward-based training. Beyond data and reward curricula, Embodied-R [143] implements a three-stage RL schedule that
gradually shifts reward weights from format to accuracy and logical consistency, guiding the model
toward coherent embodied reasoning. NoisyRollout [55] implicitly applies curriculum via a noise
annealing schedule—starting with distorted visual inputs and gradually reducing noise—promoting
early exploration and stable convergence without added cost.
4.3.2 Sample Efficiency. RL-based reasoning heavily relies on high-quality samples to guide effective policy optimization. Insufficient or unreliable samples can lead to slow convergence and

improves sample efficiency via Adaptive-Length CoT Distillation, which adjusts reasoning chain
length to reduce computation, and a Hybrid Optimization Framework that iteratively refines the
model using both high-confidence and error samples, reducing dependence on large-scale annotations. MM-Eureka [69] proposes a two-stage training strategy, with the second stage focusing on
enhancing the model using domain-specific data. Additionally, the authors introduce the MMK12
1 multimodal mathematical reasoning dataset to highlight the importance of high-quality data.
GFlowVLM [40] adopts generative flow networks to sample and learn from high-value reasoning
trajectories, enabling efficient off-policy training and promoting diverse yet meaningful exploration.
LMM-R1 [74] employs a two-stage method, FRE followed by MGT, where the model is first trained
on textual data to enhance reasoning and then generalized to other modalities, thereby mitigating
the scarcity of high-quality multimodal data. MetaSpatial [73] introduces a GRPO-based multi-turn
refinement strategy, selecting higher-quality grouped trajectories to accelerate spatial reasoning.
NoisyRollout [55] demonstrates strong generalization with only 2.1K samples by mixing clean and
noisy rollouts, enhancing learning through visual diversity at no extra cost.
4.3.3 Catastrophic forgetting. Catastrophic forgetting refers to the phenomenon where models,
after fine-tuning on new tasks, lose previously acquired abilities. SFT often induces catastrophic
forgetting by overwriting prior capabilities, whereas RL, by optimizing reward signals rather than
explicit outputs, better preserves general reasoning skills [58, 74]. In addition to the inherent
advantages of RL, the mainstream solution in current RL-based methods to mitigate this issue is to
incorporate a KL regularization term, which helps prevent excessive parameter drift [62, 72, 91].
Curr-ReFT [19] proposes Rejected Sample-based Self-improvement, a method that selectively learns
from high-quality multimodal and textual examples to maintain the fundamental capabilities of
MLLMs. This approach ensures that while enhancing the model’s ability to perform new tasks, it
retains its original knowledge and skills.

RLHF Training Framework

In recent years, the rise of RLHF and reward learning has led to the emergence of various open-source
libraries that lower research barriers and enhance development efficiency. Table 6 summarizes
major RLHF frameworks and their supported algorithms. DeepSpeed-Chat [77] enables efficient,
cost-effective ChatGPT-style model training. OpenRLHF [34] supports distributed training for

large models and integrates with HuggingFace. LLaMA-Factory [146] offers broad model and
training method support with a visual interface. TRL [96] focuses on post-training techniques
like PPO and DPO with distributed support. Colossal-AI [46] simplifies large-scale training with
parallel strategies. VeRL [83] targets multimodal and vision-language tasks with modular design.
Open-R1 [23] and its fork EasyR1 [127] replicate and extend the DeepSeek-R1 pipeline. R1-V [11]
emphasizes long-chain reasoning in vision-language models. Together, these frameworks offer
diverse capabilities that accelerate innovation in RLHF research.

Applications with RL-Based MLLM Reasoning

RL has substantially expanded the application boundaries of MLLMs across diverse domains. By
enhancing the structured reasoning ability of MLLMs through optimized reward mechanisms and
policy improvements, RL-based methods enable models to adapt to increasingly complex real-world
tasks. In this section, we categorize the emerging applications of RL-based MLLM reasoning into
three major areas: Embodied AI, MLLM Agentic Systems, and Domain-Specific Applications of
RL-Based Multimodal Reasoning.
5.1 Embodied AI
Embodied AI focuses on enabling MLLMs to perceive, reason, and act in physical or simulated
environments. RL-based multimodal reasoning methods have become pivotal in improving models’
ability to interpret multimodal inputs and to generate action-oriented reasoning strategies. Models
such as MetaSpatial [73] demonstrate the capability of integrating physics-based rewards and
perceptual feedback to support three-dimensional scene understanding and object manipulation.
Similarly, Video-R1 [27] extends reasoning into the temporal domain, enabling video-based agents
to infer causal relationships between sequential frames, a critical aspect for embodied perception
in dynamic environments. Embodied-R [143] proposes a collaborative RL framework that activates
embodied spatial reasoning by decoupling perception and reasoning, achieving superior performance and generalization with a logical consistency reward. The reinforcement learning framework
facilitates iterative learning of spatial, temporal, and causal relations, allowing embodied MLLMs
to achieve stronger generalization and physical realism. Autonomous driving can also be viewed as
a representative embodied scenario, where RL-enhanced MLLMs hold promise for future advances
in spatial-temporal reasoning and decision-making.
5.2

MLLM Agentic System

As MLLMs evolve beyond passive perception and generation, a critical frontier lies in the development of agentic systems—models capable of goal-directed reasoning, autonomous decision-making,
and interaction with dynamic environments. An agentic MLLM is expected not only to understand
multimodal contexts but also to proactively plan, act, and adapt based on evolving task demands. RL
provides a natural framework for cultivating such capabilities, by treating reasoning and interaction
as sequential decision processes.
In interactive scenarios such as GUI-based task execution, UI-R1 [65] demonstrates the importance
of multimodal action reasoning. By jointly optimizing rewards for action type prediction, argument
selection, and output formatting, the model effectively learns to perform sequences of operations,
aligning its outputs with human-intended goals. GUI-R1 [114] enhances the GUI capabilities
of MLLM in advanced real-world task scenarios by unifying action types, input text, and click
coordinates into a standardized action space framework. InfiGUI-R1 [57] advances GUI agents from
reactive execution to deliberative reasoning via a two-stage RL framework, enhancing planning
and error recovery through sub-goal guidance and reflective correction.

Domain-Specific Applications of RL-Based Multimodal Reasoning

Beyond general embodied and agentic capabilities, RL–based multimodal reasoning has been
increasingly applied to a range of specialized real-world domains that demand high levels of
perception and decision-making under complex conditions. By leveraging structured rewards and
sequential learning frameworks, these methods enable MLLMs to move beyond static understanding
toward dynamic, context-sensitive behavior. Domains such as medical and healthcare, as well as
human-centered interaction, serve as critical testbeds for evaluating and advancing the robustness,
generalization, and interpretability of RL-empowered multimodal systems.
5.3.1 Medical and Healthcare. The medical and healthcare domains present unique demands for
high-stakes reasoning, interpretability, and generalization. RL-based multimodal reasoning methods
have shown promising progress in tasks such as medical visual question answering and clinical
decision support. MedVLM-R1 [72] improves answer verifiability by rewarding structured reasoning
traces for multiple-choice tasks. ChestX-Reasoner [25] applies process-supervised reinforcement
learning to align model reasoning with clinical workflows, using supervision signals extracted from
radiology reports. This approach enhances factuality, completeness, and diagnostic relevance of
generated reasoning chains, while also improving outcome accuracy across diverse tasks such as
disease classification, anomaly detection, and temporal comparison.
5.3.2 Social and Human. Understanding human behavior, emotions, and social interactions is
an emerging frontier for RL-based multimodal reasoning. R1-Omni [144] integrates audio, video,
and text to enhance emotional recognition via RL, enabling structured socio-emotional reasoning.
Similarly, R1-AQA [44] trains MLLMs to interpret acoustic signals for auditory reasoning. These
capabilities support empathetic AI agents and socially adaptive systems, where RL facilitates
robustness, error recovery, and personalized interaction.

Datasets and Benchmark

To comprehensively evaluate the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, researchers have developed a variety of benchmark datasets spanning different reasoning paradigms and modalities. In this section,
we categorize these datasets into three high-level domains: Reasoning over Structured Knowledge
Domains, Contextual and Perceptual Reasoning in Real-World Scenarios, and Generalization and
Multi-Task Reasoning Benchmarks, with each domain encompassing several sub-domains that
reflect distinct types of knowledge, reasoning structures, or contextual challenges. An overview
of these representative benchmarks is illustrated in Figure 3. We summarize the performance of
current open-source and closed-source reasoning models on mainstream reasoning benchmarks in
Table 7. Among these, Mulberry [125], LLaVA-CoT [118], Insight-V [22], and LLaVA-Reasoner [141]
are mainstream reasoning models that do not rely on RL, while the remaining models are RL-based.
From Table 7, it is evident that a significant portion of current evaluations is concentrated in the first
domain, particularly in mathematical, scientific, and chart-based reasoning tasks. This focus reveals
a fundamental limitation: the dominance of well-structured, mathematically grounded benchmarks
leaves open the question of whether these models can generalize to more complex, open-ended,
and perceptually rich scenarios. Tasks that require interaction with dynamic environments, spatial
abstraction, multimodal alignment, or socio-cultural reasoning are underrepresented, despite being
critical for real-world applications. To address this limitation, we further include a range of benchmarks under the latter two categories, covering diverse scenarios such as user interface action
prediction, 6D spatial reasoning, visual-to-code generation, and culturally grounded multimodal
understanding. These datasets provide a more comprehensive lens for evaluating MLLMs’ reasoning

abilities beyond traditional symbolic domains. In the following, we present a detailed analysis of
representative benchmarks within each sub-domain.
6.1

Reasoning over Structured Knowledge Domains

This category encompasses benchmarks that evaluate reasoning within structured and well-defined
knowledge domains, such as mathematics, science, and programming. These tasks typically involve
symbolic inputs and domain-specific visuals, including equations, diagrams, or structured textual
prompts. The benchmarks are designed to assess whether MLLMs can perform formal symbolic
manipulation, conduct multi-step logical inference, and abstract visual-textual relationships within
highly regular and semantically rich contexts.
Mathematical Reasoning. A broad range of benchmarks have been proposed to assess the mathematical reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models, with tasks that require precise
alignment between symbolic understanding, visual interpretation, and logical deduction. MathVista
[63], MathVerse [140], and WE-MATH [76] focus on school-level mathematical problems presented
in multimodal formats, including equation solving, geometric diagrams, and accompanying textual
prompts. These datasets test models’ abilities to interpret structured mathematical content, navigate
spatial relationships, and perform multi-step numeric reasoning. MATH-Vision [99] and MV-MATH
[101] extend this paradigm by transforming LaTeX-based mathematical expressions into images,
evaluating whether models can comprehend symbolic structures purely from visual representations.

Table 7. Performance of RL-Based MLLMs on Reasoning Benchmarks.

abstract reasoning and competition-level problem-solving that often requires multi-hop inference.
The uniqueness of MathScape [148] lies in its vision-centered, open-ended question design, which
integrates abstract symbolic reasoning with contextual visual cues. This setting encourages models
to transcend direct computation and fosters the development of analogy-based and relational
understanding capabilities. CMM-Math [54] further incorporates CoT prompting into multimodal
mathematical reasoning, providing structured intermediate steps to assess whether models can
generate interpretable reasoning paths across both vision and language modalities.
Chart Reasoning. Chart-based reasoning benchmarks evaluate the ability of MLLMs to extract
structured information from visual plots and perform quantitative analysis grounded in natural
language. ChartBench [122] and MultiChartQA [151] present a wide range of questions over diverse
chart types, such as bar graphs, pie charts, and line plots, requiring aggregation, comparison,
or prediction over visual data. CharXiv [106] adopts a more challenging evaluation setting by
sourcing all charts from real-world scientific publications. The benchmark incorporates complex
domain-specific notations, multi-subplot layouts, and visually dense figures, as well as semantically
ambiguous or unanswerable questions, thereby substantially increasing the task complexity.
Scientific Reasoning. Scientific reasoning benchmarks aim to assess a model’s ability to integrate domain-specific visual information with conceptual understanding across disciplines such
as physics, chemistry, and biology. MMMU [133] and MMMU-Pro [134] provide large-scale multimodal assessments based on academic exam questions, with inputs that include circuit diagrams,
biological illustrations, and chemical reaction graphs. These benchmarks demand subject-specific
knowledge and cross-modal multi-hop inference. M4U [98] extends this direction by constructing
a a multilingual benchmark that covers 64 disciplines. Its tasks feature rich visual materials such as

graphs, experimental setups, and symbolic content, paired with multilingual questions designed to
test the deep scientific understanding, multilingual alignment, and multimodal reasoning capabilities of MLLMs in real-world educational settings. MDK12-Bench [149] complements these efforts
by focusing on structured academic reasoning across core school subjects, while incorporating
dynamic evaluation to enhance robustness. ScienceQA [64] and TheoremQA [13] offer grade-school
to high-school level science problems that emphasize explanation and factual integration, often
including illustrated contexts or structured diagrams. GAOKAO-MM [152] and CMMMU [28]
reflect the format of high-stakes standardized tests, containing visually dense problem structures
with minimal textual scaffolding. EMMA [32] further enhances the realism of scientific instruction
by combining textual questions with experimental setups or process diagrams, requiring temporal
reasoning and procedural interpretation. To address the issue of visual leakage in multimodal
evaluation datasets, MM-Star [10] assesses the multimodal capabilities of LVLM by constructing a
carefully balanced and purified sample selection process, with the aim of benchmarking six core
competencies and 18 detailed axes.
Code Generation. Benchmarks in this category evaluate the ability of MLLMs to generate code
based on multimodal visual prompts, such as plots or interface sketches. ChartMimic [84] and
Plot2Code [110] require models to produce plotting scripts such as matplotlib that replicate the
semantics and structure of a given graph. These tasks test visual layout parsing, semantic inference,
and parameter mapping between modalities. HumanEval-V [138] extends this framework by offering
open-ended coding tasks guided by visual problem descriptions, where models must synthesize
intent, logic, and implementation through image-grounded reasoning.
Algorithmic Problem. The NPHardEval4V [24] benchmark focuses on visually rendered algorithmic reasoning tasks, including classical problems such as graph coloring, knapsack optimization,
and shortest path computation. The tasks require interpreting structured visual representations
and aim to explore the model’s ability to map visual configurations to algorithmic abstractions and
perform reasoning within computationally complex solution spaces.
Social and Cultural Knowledge Reasoning. This subcategory evaluates MLLMs’ ability to reason
about sociocultural, geographic, and symbolic content presented in visual form. II-Bench [60],
CII-Bench [137], PunchBench [71], and GeoComp [85] introduce tasks involving photographs,
illustrations, posters, and maps, where models must interpret not only the visual content but also
its embedded cultural or societal implications. CII-Bench [137] features Chinese cultural imagery
including traditional art and contemporary symbolism, probing metaphor understanding and
emotional alignment. PunchBench [71] and GeoComp [85] emphasize spatial-social reasoning
grounded in world knowledge and demographic cues. These datasets evaluate whether models can
go beyond surface-level perception to perform culturally and contextually sensitive reasoning.
6.2

Contextual and Perceptual Reasoning in Real-World Scenarios

This category focuses on benchmarks that simulate real-world scenarios where reasoning is
grounded in contextual understanding and perceptual input. Tasks often involve dynamic visual
contexts, user interfaces, or spatiotemporal environments that require MLLMs to interpret situational cues, predict goal-directed actions, or reason about spatial relationships. These benchmarks
evaluate whether models can align visual perception, linguistic instructions, and environmental
constraints to perform coherent reasoning in interactive or temporally evolving settings.
Action Prediction. Benchmarks in this subcategory simulate scenarios where agents must make
predictions or decisions based on dynamic visual contexts. Driving-Hazard-Prediction-and-Reasoning
[7] presents real-world traffic images and sequential scenarios to assess hazard identification and

behavioral prediction. InfiGUIAgent-Data [56], Mind2Web [20], and SeeClick [16] extend this to
user-interface environments, requiring models to reason about user intent and anticipate interactions with graphical user interfaces. Mind2Web [20] further introduces a broad set of high-level
web-based tasks grounded in real-world websites, evaluating models on instruction following,
multi-step planning, and interface understanding.
Spatial Reasoning. Spatial reasoning benchmarks target the model’s understanding of object layout, spatial relationships, and three-dimensional scene structure. iVISPAR [67] evaluates MLLMs on
spatial visual question answering tasks involving object localization, spatial relation inference, and
layout understanding in cluttered indoor scenes. It emphasizes relational reasoning and occlusion
modeling based on realistic 2D imagery. PulseCheck457 [102] advances this work by introducing
the first benchmark explicitly designed for 6D spatial reasoning. It assesses models on multi-object
recognition, 2D and 3D positioning, and 3D orientation within a synthetic, unbiased environment,
covering five difficulty levels and seven question types. This provides structured diagnostics for
spatial abstraction capabilities in embodied robotics and AR/VR applications. GeoSense [120]
further emphasizes symbolic-visual integration by evaluating geometric principle identification
and application in diagram-based reasoning. VisuLogic [121] targets core visual reasoning skills,
focusing on symmetry, rotation, folding, and positional changes in structured visual puzzles.
6.3

Generalization and Multi-Task Reasoning Benchmarks

This category includes composite benchmarks designed to assess MLLMs’ abilities in multi-task
reasoning, cross-domain generalization, and zero-shot adaptation. These datasets typically aggregate diverse tasks across modalities, testing whether models can perform structured inference
with minimal supervision. Tasks range from multimodal CoT generation to inductive abstraction
and analogical reasoning, providing a comprehensive evaluation of models’ capacity to generalize
beyond domain-specific constraints and perform flexible reasoning over heterogeneous inputs.
Multi-Image Based Inductive Reasoning. To evaluate inductive abstraction and rule discovery,
benchmarks like MM-IQ [6], LogicVista [116], and PuzzleTest [94] present visual matrix-style
puzzles inspired by Raven’s Progressive Matrices. These benchmark challenge models to infer
abstract transformations, detect visual analogies, and fill in missing patterns by synthesizing
structural invariants across multiple image frames. They emphasize high-level visual abstraction
and the ability to generalize across non-linguistic reasoning patterns.
Multi-Task and Generalization-Oriented Benchmarks. A growing number of composite benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate generalized multimodal reasoning across varied tasks and
domains. Representative datasets such as VRC-Bench [93] and MLLM-COMPBench [41] aggregate
subtasks including visual QA, multi-hop reasoning, and tool-based inference, offering a unified
setup for multi-skill evaluation. VCR-Bench [75] further extends this line into the video domain
by incorporating annotated CoT steps and assessing both answer and reasoning quality across
temporal tasks. Notably, M3CoT [12] and MME-CoT [39] include multimodal CoT annotations,
enabling fine-grained process supervision during inference. Meanwhile, ZeroBench [78] targets
zero-shot generalization across unseen tasks and modalities, testing model transferability and
robustness without instruction tuning. Together, these benchmarks offer a comprehensive suite for
evaluating holistic, structured, and cross-modal reasoning under diverse and complex inputs.

Limitations, Challenges and Future Directions
Limitations and Challenges

7.1.1 Limitations. Despite the remarkable progress of RL-based reasoning methods in enhancing
MLLMs, current research still faces multiple structural and theoretical limitations that hinder both
generalization and scalability.
Sparsity of reward signals. One of the most pressing issues is the sparsity and delayed nature
of reward signals. To avoid reward hacking, most RL-enhanced MLLMs are trained using scalar
final-task rewards—such as answer correctness or classification accuracy—that only reflect task
outcomes but offer no intermediate feedback throughout the reasoning process. This leaves the
model blind to structural errors in earlier reasoning steps. The most immediate consequence of this
issue is overthinking, where the model generates excessively long or redundant reasoning paths,
with intermediate steps potentially including irrelevant visual or textual cues. Although recent
works [19, 139] have introduced process-oriented feedback through intermediate step verification or
curriculum-style stage partitioning, these designs are often handcrafted, task-specific, and difficult
to generalize across unseen modalities or new domains.
Evaluation paradigms. Another limitation lies in the benchmark-centric and static nature of
current evaluation paradigms. Many RL-based MLLMs are trained and tested on a limited range of
benchmarks, which are typically narrow in scope and fail to reflect the complexity and unpredictability of real-world multimodal reasoning. As a result, models trained on such benchmarks, especially
smaller-scale ones, tend to exhibit poor transferability when applied to dynamic environments or
introduced to new modalities like audio or 3D spatial layouts.
Real-time adaptivity and interactivity. Furthermore, current approaches lack real-time adaptivity
and interactivity. Most reinforcement signals are generated offline and assume static input-output
mappings. In contrast, realistic deployments—such as embodied agents, web assistants, or interactive tutoring systems—require continuous feedback loops, the ability to revise reasoning, and
responsiveness to user corrections. Without such interactive adaptability, many current MLLMs
cannot bridge the gap between simulation-based training and open-world reasoning tasks.
7.1.2 Challenges. Beyond structural limitations, MLLM-RL pipelines face key challenges in optimization, multimodal alignment, and training infrastructure. A central issue is aligning diverse
modalities such as images, text, audio, and spatial layouts under weak supervision. Real-world
tasks often require complex cross-modal mappings with limited direct supervision, and designing
reward functions to support consistent alignment, especially in open-ended scenarios, remains
unsolved. Another challenge is modeling non-Markovian dependencies in reasoning trajectories.
Unlike traditional RL, MLLM reasoning requires long-term consistency across modalities and steps.
Although some work [40, 73] has addressed this, optimization in non-Markovian spaces is prone to
instability, noisy gradients, and unclear credit assignment. Finally, training-inference mismatch persists: models trained with fixed prompts and deterministic rewards are evaluated on unpredictable
inputs, variable reasoning lengths, and ambiguous outputs—compromising real-world performance
despite strong benchmarks.
7.2

Future Directions

To overcome these limitations and challenges, we propose several concrete directions for future
research that can contribute to more robust, generalizable, and interactive RL in MLLMs:
Unified and hierarchical reward frameworks. Future work should focus on designing multi-level
reward signals that capture not only task outcomes but also the fidelity of reasoning and cross-modal

coherence. For example, hybrid rewards can integrate accuracy, structure, and quality, thereby
improving sample efficiency, interpretability, and policy stability.
Reward generalization across modalities. To move beyond handcrafted or task-specific rewards,
future models should adopt modular or learnable reward functions that generalize across images,
videos, audio, and 3D modalities. Meta-learned reward functions or reward transformers that map
trajectories to score distributions could reduce the reliance on extensive human supervision.
Scalable and lightweight reinforcement optimization. A promising research direction is the development of lightweight RL techniques suitable for resource-constrained models. This includes
curriculum learning, KL-regularized off-policy methods, and contrastive reward estimation. Such
strategies can facilitate broader adoption in scenarios where deploying large models is infeasible.
Interactive reinforcement via user feedback. Incorporating real-time user preferences, corrections,
and demonstrations during test-time can help create continuously adapting MLLMs. Instead of
relying on synthetic reward approximators, future systems could be equipped with interfaces for
interactive reward elicitation, expanding the scope of RL in dynamic, user-centered settings.
Embodied and grounded multimodal environments. Deploying MLLMs in spatially grounded
environments such as robotics and AR/VR requires reinforcement learning strategies capable of
handling physical constraints, causal relationships, and temporal dynamics. This includes integrating spatial consistency checks, collision detection, and user affordance modeling into the reward
computation pipeline, as seen in MetaSpatial.

Conclusion

In this survey, we presented a comprehensive overview of RL-based reasoning methods in MLLMs.
We analyzed recent progress in RL optimization strategies, categorized value-model-free and valuemodel-based approaches, and discussed reward mechanism designs that enable MLLMs to reason
across text, vision, audio, and video modalities. By summarizing benchmark datasets, evaluation
protocols, and practical applications, we provided a structured understanding of how RL is shaping
the development of multimodal reasoning. While significant advancements have been made, RLbased multimodal reasoning still faces critical challenges. Current methods often rely on text-centric
reasoning paths, underutilize multimodal information, and depend heavily on simple, verifiable
reward designs. Furthermore, issues such as sparse and delayed rewards, inefficient exploration
strategies, and limited generalization to open-ended tasks remain key obstacles. Looking ahead,
future research should explore hierarchical and structured reward models, dynamic cross-modal
CoT generation, and lightweight, scalable RL frameworks. Addressing these challenges is crucial
for enabling MLLMs to perform more robust, interpretable, and generalized reasoning across realworld multimodal tasks. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable reference for researchers and
practitioners, and inspire further innovation in this rapidly evolving field.
